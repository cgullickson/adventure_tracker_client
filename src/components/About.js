      <h3>Adventure Tracker was created as a way for people to keep track of the various adventures that they take over the course of their lives.
      It can be used as a travel journal, a way to keep track of the sporting events that you attend, or a place to document concerts, ski trips,
      or any other type of adventure that you can imagine. Keep adventuring and enjoy!
